# End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates the complete workflow of building, deploying, and monitoring a machine learning solution. It covers all major stages, including:

- **Problem Definition:** Understanding the business problem and defining objectives.
- **Data Collection:** Gathering and consolidating relevant datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and analyzing data to extract insights.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating and selecting meaningful features.
- **Model Selection:** Comparing different algorithms and selecting the best model.
- **Model Training:** Training the selected model on prepared data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Model Deployment:** Integrating the model into a production environment.
- **Monitoring & Maintenance:** Tracking model performance and updating as needed.

This repository contains code, documentation, and resources for each stage of the ML pipeline.
